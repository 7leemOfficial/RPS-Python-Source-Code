# RPS-Python-Source-Code
- Hey! Just know that this is just a source code. To run this, please open any website that runs python code for you!
- Any issues? Tell me in the issues section!
- You can make any mods to this, but just know that this is RAW PYTHON. No libraries were used.
- I've made a similar project on Code.org, but I won't share it. (My JavaScript code is terrible)
